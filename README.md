This repo contains my solutions to [Advent of Code, 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020).

## Prerequisites

You will need `go` installed. Recommend installing [`brew` ](https://brew.sh/) and running `brew install go`.

## Running the Solutions

Download, build, and install the solutions like so:

```sh
# Download, build, and install solutions from this repo
go get github.com/dds/aoc2020/...

# Run solution for day 1
day1

# Get input for day 20, wait up to 8h, and copy to clipboard if successful
aocinput 20 --session=<session_cookie> --timeout=8h --clipboard
```

## How To

For each day, copy the `scaffold.go` file into a directory for the day, so day 1 you would:

```sh
mkdir day1
cp scaffold.go day1/day1.go
```
